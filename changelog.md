# Changelog
This is the final planned changelog for CH. More may come, but it's pretty unlikely. I made this game a very long time ago, and it would take more effort than it's worth to completely reconstitute it, and I'm focusing on my newer projects like [Birdwatch](https://replit.com/@CatR3kd/BIRDWATCH-Multiplayer-Text-Adventure?v=1). (At the time of writing) If there's anything seriously required of me or this game, reach out by joining [the Discord](https://discord.gg/ppPZX4D7Wf). NOT for suggestions or dev requests.
